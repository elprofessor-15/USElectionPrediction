# USElectionPrediction
This project performs sentiment analysis on two datasets containing user text. The text is preprocessed by removing stopwords, punctuation, URLs, HTML tags, and lowercasing. Using the VADER lexicon, sentiments (Positive, Negative, Neutral) are determined, providing insights into text sentiment distribution.
